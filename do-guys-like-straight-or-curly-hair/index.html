There�s a type of curly hair (nothing extreme) which i can�t explain, which i would go crazy for. True enough, but if your hair is truly curly/wavy it�s actually kind of a ***** to straighten it unless you get it professionally done. I love curly hair, although on guys it usually looks better if it�s shorter, so you don�t have huge hair. He might love curly hair over straight hair because it is the natural hair of the woman that he is seeing at the time.
