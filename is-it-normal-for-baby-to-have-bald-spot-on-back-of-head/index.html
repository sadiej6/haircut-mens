First and foremost, baby hair care requires one of those soft baby brushes to smooth down hair and gently brush skin flakes away. Hair loss in children can be caused by a number of issues including hair pulling, hormone imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies. So, if parietal bone growth is minimal, a small bald spot might slowly start to develop. Hollier says you can prevent bald spots from happening (if the cause is positional) by alternating your baby�s head from either side during sleep in order to prevent too much pressure in one.
