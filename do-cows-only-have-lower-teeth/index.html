Cows Don�t Have Upper Front Teeth NSSB From naturestudysociety.org
In the front of the mouth, teeth (known as incisors) are only located on the bottom jaw. In lieu of teeth, the top jaw is equipped with a hard palate that the deer uses in the same way it would use teeth. Dental anatomy in cattle dentition is the development of teeth within the mouth. In horses, which have hypsodont dentition (characterized by reserve crown length with continual eruption), relative increase in the height of the teeth makes up for occlusal wear, which occurs at a rate of approximately 2.5 mm/year until approximately 17 years of age.
