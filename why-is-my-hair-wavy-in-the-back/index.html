It is not at all unusual for the �rain coat� of thicker, oily hair along a labrador�s back to have a bit of a wave to it. As well as affecting the quality of your hair, hormones can change your muscle tone too. And just as hormones may impact hair texture, any medications that affect hormones, such as glucocorticoids or thyroxine, could also potentially make hair become wavy or curly. If you still have straight hair in the front, it is more than likely the remaining damaged hair.
