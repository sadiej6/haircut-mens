Bangs/ Fringes for Round Faces From becomegorgeous.com
Wispy bangs are a beautifully soft style that looks good on almost anyone. Go for a cool pair of parted bangs like rihanna�s. If you’re trying to decide if you should get bangs or not, hold a section of hair up so the last couple of inches of it simulate bangs and see if you think you�d look good with them. Maybe it�s the blunt cut of your bangs that�s bothering you, and a stylist could help by softening it up.
