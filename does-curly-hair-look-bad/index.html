My husband has super curly hair and he struggled with this for a while. I am aware that my hair will continue to change and get healthier, so the first products i tried might “work better” now than they did when i was new to the curly hair thing. Your hair is very frizzy, especially when it is humid. It’s amazing when you can find someone who knows how to cut curly hair but until then, i would probably look up videos on youtube about tips to cut curly hair well so that when you go to get it done, you can tell them.
