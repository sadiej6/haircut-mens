Why Does Black People Hair Not Grow Or Take Long To Grow From youtube.com
The hair�s are normal, we all get different thickness in hairs this could be due to hormones, age or just new hair. By the way if you�re pulling it out and it does not have a white tip, it�s because this strand was not yet ready to fall on its own. Volumizing and thickening shampoos can be a great solution for both fine and thin hair, but just know that each will produce a slightly different result. Any hair that grows out of this blackhead is super long and thick and fast growing too.
