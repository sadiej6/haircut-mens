You Should Be Sleeping With Your Hair In A Bun Every Night From pinterest.com
The choice of tying hair while sleeping differs from person to person and depends on the type of hair you have. This is mainly because your hair is nicely cocooned inside the cap, allowing your natural oils to condition and protect the length of your hair while you sleep. Make sure you brush your hair from your scalp roots to tips before you hit the bed. To keep your hair straight while you sleep, sleep with a silk or satin pillowcase, since these materials will reduce friction between your hair and pillow, thereby preventing frizzy ends.
