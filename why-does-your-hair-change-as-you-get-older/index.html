Why do i have a receding hairline at 16 From onettechnologiesindia.com
Your hair follicles produce less color as they age, so when hair goes through its natural cycle of dying and being regenerated, it’s more likely to grow in as gray beginning after age 35. Genetics (how fast your family ages will most likely influence your ageing) from adulthood, we tend to start losing pigment slowly. Because of these aging and environmental changes, some hair follicles stop producing new hair altogether. If you have ageing hair, you may have noticed that your strands feel dry and less smooth.
