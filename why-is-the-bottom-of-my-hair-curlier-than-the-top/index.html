F.A.Q.s From divaswigs.com
Damage can certainly affect the curl (or lack of curl) in your hair, though variation is totally normal. I think the moisture of my wet hair, paired with the fact that it is so close to my face (body heat) makes a sort of humid hair climate, so the parts of my ahir that are closer to my head are more. When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. You see, when external layers are cut, all the weight of your hair is removed from the outside of your hair.
