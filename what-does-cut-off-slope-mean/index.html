So what exactly does cut to fill mean? When i�ve tried using the usual line level subwoofer setup with various subs in the past i�ve never got the whole freq range to sound as seamless as the rel method. In this case, you must dig down 1 from the bottom of the current grade to reach the desired 2% grade. A slope of 2:1 is illustrated in figure 2.
