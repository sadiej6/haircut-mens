HOW TO REFRESH YOUR CURLS! refreshing my 3rd day curly From youtube.com
Posted by 1 hour ago. In around 2015, i bleached the top/front of my hair at home, twice on the same day, and i think i damaged the follicles, because that section has only gotten more and more curly as time goes on,it started at the temples and being frizzy. The combo of sun, salt water, sand, and wind can be very drying, not to mention leave your hair gnarly with nasty tangles. If you still have straight hair in the front, it is more than likely the remaining damaged hair.
