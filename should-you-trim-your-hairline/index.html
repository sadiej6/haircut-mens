If you aren’t happy with your low hairline, you can ask your hairstylist to use the edgers to trim your hairline a little higher (without cutting too high into the hairline). The big take home is that you should not just try to cover up your receding hairline, but be confident and experiment with different styles. This type of cut can reduce the appearance of your receding hairline significantly and has the added benefit of being extremely low maintenance. You can always remove more hair if you choose, but if you cut.
