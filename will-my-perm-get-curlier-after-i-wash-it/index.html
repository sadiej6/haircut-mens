Permed Hair Not Curly Enough ThriftyFun From thriftyfun.com
Hence, when washing hair after a perm it may be advised to shift to a hydrating shampoo and conditioner. Simply because the strong airflow of a diffuser hits the curls much harder and if they haven’t had time to dry in their shape, they’ll get messy. After that, take your perm solution and apply it in a circular motion. That means that if your hair is naturally straight, washing it too quickly after a perm will relax and ruin the perm curls.
