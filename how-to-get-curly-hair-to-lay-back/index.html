Pulling back curly hair without destroying its curls pattern From justcurly.com
Apply curl cream to damp hair to encourage curls to bounce back. When the cuticle is open, your hair will be able to soak up tons of moisture, but if you do not close the cuticle with cold water afterwards then all of the moisture will escape, your curls will be dehydrated and thirsty curls don’t clump! Spending a long time in front of the mirror in the morning to get beautiful waves is also stressful. Apply a generous amount of curl cream to each section from the roots to the tips.
