What Are the Best Long Hairstyles for Older Women? Hair From hadviser.com
Don’t let your hair age you. If you’re not a fan of going gray just yet, you’ll be happy to know that your monthly paint job is also working to make your hair look fuller, because the dye coats the hair shafts, making them thicker. And the majority of women over 40 dye their hair, so you can imagine the type of pushback women get when they decide to go gray with long hair. The texture of your gray hair is probably not the same as the texture of your former color, so you�ll need to care for it in a different way.
