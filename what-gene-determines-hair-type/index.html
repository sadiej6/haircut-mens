<p>Another pair of alleles determines hair length (short and long). Blonde hair is a recessive gene and brown hair is a dominant gene. This dilution gene determines the intensity of pigmentation. Type 1 is straight hair that doesn�t curl. In dogs, one pair of alleles determines coat color (dark or albino). Understanding.</p>

The texture of our hair is mainly determined by our dna. Each parent carries two alleles (gene variants) for hair color. You may have learned in high school that traits like hair color, eye color, and more are determined by dominant and recessive genes. The hair texture of a person depends on multiple genes and alleles. The melanophilin gene (mlph) at the d locus causes a dilution mainly of eumelanin, while phaeomelanin is less affected.</p>
<p>The texture of a person�s hair is determined by the shape of their hair follicles. The hair texture of a person depends on multiple genes and alleles.
