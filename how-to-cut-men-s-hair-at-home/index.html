How to cut men’s hair from home, according to celebrity From everythinglubbock.com
For hair longer than an inch, you may have to use a pair of styling scissors to make precise cuts; If you cut hair so it�s all the same length, it won�t have a lot of definition and it may look flat. Use the tips of the scissors to trim the hair across the back of the neck. All you need is a set of hair cutting scissors and a fine comb ( this set on amazon is a great deal!), and a set of hair clippers for around the ears and neckline.
