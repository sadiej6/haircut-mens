This condition causes hair loss in small, typically unnoticeable bald patches. This maturing process occurs between 17 and 29 years of age and it is not uncommon to find one side go up faster than the other side. I am 33 yrs old and just recently in the last 3 months i’ve noticed progressive hair loss near my crown and parts and my hair gets really oily like one day after i shower in my crown area.
