Once your hair is smooth, secure the hair in a medium to low positioned ponytail, pulling the hair only half way through on its final rotation. If it�s done too tight, it can damage hair at the roots or simply cause discomfort while sleeping. Long straight hair can drag your face down and make you look old. If your hair is too long to wear in a traditional pineapple, you can gently wrap it in a loose bun, and use loose clips to hold the ends out of your face.
