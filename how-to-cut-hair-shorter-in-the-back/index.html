So that if you want your man�s hair to work in a backward motion what you need to do is start shorter in the front and work longer towards the back and then it will move backwards. When you brush your hair out, it will be the same length. Just make sure your haircut does not go shorter in the front and longer in the back. It can be as steep or as subtle as you like, but to give the illusion of full, thick hair, a shorter cut at the back works best.
