Essentially, it is a surface phenomenon—mainly in governance to the law of conservation of energy and momentum. If one side of the wave hits a shallow region before the other side it makes the wave change direction. Refraction is the bending of the path of a light wave as it passes from one material into another material. Even if waves are coming in from deep water at an angle to the beach, the move to shallower water means that the waves will slow down and curve around (refract) so they are more parallel as the surf hits the beach.

<p>Light waves may change direction at the boundary between two transparent materials. Refraction, however occurs when a wave changed mediums, so if a wave were to go from moving in air to moving in water, the wave would change a direction that is based upon the index of refraction of that given medium.

<p>The light wave not only changes directions at the boundary, it also speeds up or slows down and transforms into a wave with a larger or a shorter wavelength. Even if waves are coming in from deep water at an angle to the beach, the move to shallower water means that the waves will slow down and curve around (refract). Phase shift of 180 degrees of.</p>

<p>Refraction is the reason why surf waves often line up parallel to the beach. The waves are refracted as they travel through the earth due to a change in density of the medium. At a free (soft) boundary, the restoring force is zero and the reflected wave has the same polarity (no phase change) as the incident wave reflection from.

Reflection is just the result of waves encountering a smooth (compared with the wavelength) surface that does not absorb them. And a portion of the energy reflects off the boundary and remains in the original medium. Waves change speed when they pass across the boundary between two different substances, such as light waves refracting when they pass from. Essentially, it is a surface phenomenon—mainly in governance to the law of conservation of energy and momentum. Water waves will change direction at a boundary between deep and shallow water.</p>
<p>Velocity will change when a wave enters a new medium. Water waves travel faster on the surface of deep water than they do on shallow water. This is why the wavefront changes direction. <em>Why does light change direction when it refracts? askscience</em>, The three main ways that waves change direction (assuming for the sake of simplicity a plane wavefront with waves travelling in a straight line) are reflection, refraction and diffraction.</p>
