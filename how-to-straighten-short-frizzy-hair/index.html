3 Ways to Straighten Curly and Thick Hair wikiHow From wikihow.com
Luckily, we have a few hair straightening products and tricks up our sleeve to help you straighten your short, curly hair. If your hair is on the finer side, use a round brush while you blow it dry to help straighten it. As a consequence, your hair starts being frizzy and dry instead of being defined and smooth. If you get a gel cast (or a cast from your mousse or other styling products) and you try to scruch out the crunch before your hair is totally dry, this can introduce frizz.
