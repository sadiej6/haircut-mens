When the leaf gets dehydrated the guard cells become flaccid making the stomata smaller. Many mammals, such as the domestic dog and cat, have a pilomotor reflex that raises their guard hairs as part of a threat display when agitated. Tactile hairs are associated with a sensory function and are much thicker and stiffer than other hairs. The most important function of hair in mammals is that of insulating against cold by conserving body heat.
