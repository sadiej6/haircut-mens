Because water evaporates fairly fast on its own from your hair as you go about your day, you need to ensure that you recreate a pseudo wet effect , which is achieved with hair spray in combination with either hair gel or hair mousse. It is similar to hair spray, but it will leave your hair feeling soft instead of tacky. Mix some conditioner with some water into a spray bottle and just shake it up, then spray on your hair little by little with your paddle brush comb your hair till all of the dry hair is wet throughout. Laying hair gel, cream, gloss, and spray onto wet hair in rapid succession is what keeps it looking damp.
