19 Best Straight Hair On Top Curly On Bottom From thinning-hair-srt.blogspot.com
Pixie hair with a long or short bang is the most. Whenever i try and style it as wavy\curly hair the straight pieces do not cooperate, and when i brush it out like straight hair all my waves are defined on the bottom and the top gets frizzy. The top layer is most exposed to the sun and elements so it usually tends to be more damaged, i would suggest treating that hair differently to the hair underneath. If you have long hair there will be more weight pulling the hair straighter.
