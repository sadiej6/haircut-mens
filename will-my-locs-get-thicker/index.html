Throughout the stages in which dreads mature, they will get thicker and thinner. Dreads or dreadlocks are coils of hair that have matted together to form locks, usually about the thickness of a finger. Normally, by this time, your locs should have all grown to the same length and will feel heavier and at the same time, more slender. As before, the amount of hair in the dreads determines how thick they are so you need to put more hair in them to make them thicker.
