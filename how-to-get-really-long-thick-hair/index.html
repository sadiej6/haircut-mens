How to get SUPER THICK &amp; LONG Hair Using a Simple Hair From youtube.com
Long hair tends to get frizzy and brittle , so cut your hair at least thrice a year to keep it looking healthy. When you’re done curling a piece of hair, remove the curling iron or wand or whatever other hot tool you’re using, and pin it up until it cools down. A natural fiber brush, like the boar bristle, helps to minimize friction when brushing. The vitamins and nutrients may improve the hair’s natural sheen, which may make it appear thicker.
