Rub your scalp, spritz with water. While tanning is not considered healthy for the skin and should be minimized, it will maintain an even color on your bald head by eliminating the patches of pale skin. Since this sounds like traction alopecia, it can probably be corrected mostly since you are very young and have stopped wearing your hair in tight styles that are hard on your hair line. Try and avoid hair products that contain chemicals or toxins that lead to hair loss, or example hair dyes, particularly hair bleaching.
