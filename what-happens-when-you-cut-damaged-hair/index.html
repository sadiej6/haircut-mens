It is better for you to buy or use a hair scissors which you can sharpen later if it gets blunt. The splits work their way up, damaging more than just the ends, causing breakage, frizz, and scraggly strands that refuse to blend with the rest of your hair. This is due to the fact that melanocyte cells which are responsible for creating melanin pigment which is responsible for the color of the hair reduce the pace of producing melanin pigments which can lead to grey hair. The only real way to repair damaged hair is by cutting off the damaged parts and letting new growth take place.
