Sound waves in a solid may be either compressive or shear. Compressive waves compress or rarify the density of the material in the direction of the wave travel. If the stern is being driven into the waves, there is not enough power to pull it around in making the course change. Reflection is just the result of waves encountering a smooth (compared with the wavelength) surface that does not absorb them and does not allow them to.

<p>If a wave is approaching the coast at an angle, the nearshore part of the wave slows more than the offshore part of the wave (because it’s in shallower water). Waves come into shore and break parallel to the coast because ocean floor topography is generally similar to the shape of the beach. A measure of the rate of doing.

<p>Energy of a wave is transported in the direction of the waves transportation. Waves transmit energy, not water, across the ocean and if not obstructed by anything, they have the potential to travel across an entire ocean basin. Many forms of energy are carried in heat, light, sound, and water waves. Recall that open ocean waves will usually be deep. Instructor Page.</p>

<p>The waves are moving more slowly just in front of the headland, causing the waves to bend. In shallower water near the coast, waves slow down because of the force exerted on them by the seabed.
