The bowl cut is back and believe it or not, there are plenty ways to make the look new every single day. If your hair is short, skip the pineapple and just pull sections up and clip them on top. If you have curly hair, you can try a high bun on the top of your crown (and not sideways or back) so that it doesn t interfere with your sleep and holds shape till morning. It takes at least 3 hours to blow dry and straighten my hair so i try to keep my hair looking good for as long as possible.
