The problem with frizzy hair is that it�s dry. Frizzy hair, also called frizz, happens when the cuticle layer of each strand of your hair opens up, allowing the moisture from the air to pass through and swell all the strands. Use hair mousse to add texture and keep your hair as normal as possible. The outer layer of the hair takes in the moisture from the air, causing the hair to swell and frizz.”jun 26, 2018.
