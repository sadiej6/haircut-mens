Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. Hair loss in diabetes may be hereditary and related to other immune system disorders, such as thyroid disease or alopecia areata. Treatment aims to prevent further destruction of your hair follicles but will not be able to make hair grow back that has already been lost. Within two weeks, the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete.
