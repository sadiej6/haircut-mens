&lt;p&gt;The most recent hypothesis suggests that the hair loss process begins during puberty, when growth of the skull and the muscles in the forehead and neck increases the tension in a tight band of tissue stretching over the top of the head. Although i will say at first i was worry about how i looked bald, but once i embraced it i realized not only did it look better i actually looked younger than when i had all those bald spots. Women grow accustomed to the bald look because many of their male peers will have much less hair at that age. If your hair loss occurs in a more regular receding pattern, usually from the temples and crown of the head, then it is more likely you have male pattern baldness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
