Epic Fail How NOT to cut very long very thick hair From haselnussblond.de
Thick hair has enough volume of its own without needing the extra help, and you would be much better off looking for a conditioner that is designed for thick hair. Waxing may sound complicated or messy, especially for thicker hair, but it’s easier than you think. If your thick tresses are weighing you down, try incorporating some layers into your hair, as they will add both lightness and movement to your style. Otherwise, you can apply on dry hair in the scalp, and rub it along the ends.
