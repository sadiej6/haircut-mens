Repair a damaged hairline and prevent future hair loss From pinterest.com
Many popular hair treatments strip the hair of its natural oils and damage the hair shaft. Inositol, an ingredient found in rice water, has been shown to penetrate damaged hair and repair hair from the inside out. Requiring no products, a vigorous scalp massage is one of the simplest ways to help boost circulation in the scalp and stretch hair follicle cells to promote thicker hair growth. That is just a trick of the trade, to make your hair appear thicker and more dense.
